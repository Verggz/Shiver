# Shiver - A 2D MonoGame based game engine written in C#

This game engine is currently being made to develop the game: [Project: Penguin](https://gamejolt.com/games/projectpenguin/538864).

## NOTES: 
- The game engine is still in very early stages of development and cannot be used as a proper game engine yet. But feel free to fork this page and work on the engine yourself.
- The Asset Folder is used as an example for how the engine should work
